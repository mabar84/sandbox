<!-- Step 5Passed
HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

Identify the main section of this page by adding a <main> opening tag before the h1 element, and a </main> closing tag after the p element. -->

<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
      <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
      <!-- TODO: Add link to cat photos -->
      <p>See more cat photos in our gallery.</p>
    </main>
