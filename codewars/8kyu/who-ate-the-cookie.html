    For this problem you must create a program that says who ate the last cookie. If the input is a string then "Zach" ate the cookie. If the input is a float
    or an int then "Monica" ate the cookie. If the input is anything else "the dog" ate the cookie. The way to return the statement is: "Who ate the last
    cookie? It was (name)!" Ex: Input = "hi" -- Output = "Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach! (The reason you return Zach is because the input is a string)
    Note: Make sure you return the correct message with correct spaces and punctuation. Please leave feedback for this kata. Cheers!
    <script>
      let x = true;
      function cookie(x) {
        const m = "Who ate the last cookie? It was Zach!";
        const f = "Who ate the last cookie? It was Monica!";
        const dog = "Who ate the last cookie? It was the dog!";
        switch (typeof x) {
          case "string":
            return m;
          case "number":
            return f;
          default:
            return dog;
        }
        return typeof x;
      }
      console.log(cookie(x));
