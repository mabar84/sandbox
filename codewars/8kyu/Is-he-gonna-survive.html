    A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each
    dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets
    and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive? Return true if yes, false otherwise
    <script>
      let bullets = 7,
        dragons = 4;
      function hero(bullets, dragons) {
        return bullets / dragons >= 2;
      }
      console.log(hero(bullets, dragons));
    </script>
