    <title>Merge two sorted arrays into one</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    You are given two sorted arrays that both only contain integers. Your task
    is to find a way to merge them into a single one, sorted in asc order.
    Complete the function mergeArrays(arr1, arr2), where arr1 and arr2 are the
    original sorted arrays. You don't need to worry about validation, since arr1
    and arr2 must be arrays with 0 or more Integers. If both arr1 and arr2 are
    empty, then just return an empty array. Note: arr1 and arr2 may be sorted in
    different orders. Also arr1 and arr2 may have same integers. Remove
    duplicated in the returned result. Examples (input -> output) * [1, 2, 3, 4,
    5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] * [1, 3, 5, 7, 9],
    [10, 8, 6, 4, 2] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] * [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,
    12], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12]
    <script>
      let arr1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12],
        arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12];
      function mergeArrays(arr1, arr2) {
        const set = new Set([...arr1, ...arr2]);
        return [...set].sort((a, b) => a - b);
      }

      // function mergeArrays(a, b) {
      //   return [...new Set(a.concat(b))].sort((a,b)=>a-b)
      // }

      console.log(mergeArrays(arr1, arr2));
    </script>
