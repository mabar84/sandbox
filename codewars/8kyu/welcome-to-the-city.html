    Create a method that takes as input a name, city, and state to welcome a person. Note that name will be an array consisting of one or more values that
    should be joined together with one space between each, and the length of the name array in test cases will vary. Example:

    <script>
      let name = ["John", "Smith"],
        city = "Phoenix",
        state = "Arizona";
      function sayHello(name, city, state) {
        return `Hello, ${name.join(" ")}! Welcome to ${city}, ${state}!`;
        // return `Hello, ${name[0]} ${name[1]}! Welcome to ${city}, ${state}!`;
      }
      console.log(sayHello(name, city, state));
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
