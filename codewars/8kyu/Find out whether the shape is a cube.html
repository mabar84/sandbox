    <title>Find out whether the shape is a cube</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:
    volume = Length * Width * Height But someone forgot to use proper record
    keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side! It's
    up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).
    Return true if the cuboid could have equal sides, return false otherwise.
    Return false for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or
    equal to 0). Note: side will be an integer

      const cubeChecker = (v, s) => s ** 3 === v && v > 0 && s > 0;

      console.log(cubeChecker(8, 2));
