    Create a function that will return a string that combines all of the letters of the three inputed strings in groups. Taking the first letter of all of the
    inputs and grouping them next to each other. Do this for every letter, see example below! E.g. Input: "aa", "bb" , "cc" => Output: "abcabc" Note: You can
    expect all of the inputs to be the same length.

    <script>
      let one = "aa",
        two = "bb",
        three = "cc";
      function tripleTrouble(one, two, three) {
        let str = "";
        for (let i = 0; i < one.length; i++) {
          str += one[i] + two[i] + three[i];
        }
        return str;

        // return Math.max(wait + on - cap, 0);
      }
      console.log(tripleTrouble(one, two, three));
    </script>
  </body>
