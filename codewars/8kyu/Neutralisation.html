  <body>
    Given two strings comprised of + and -, return a new string which shows how
    the two strings interact in the following way: When positives and positives
    interact, they remain positive. When negatives and negatives interact, they
    remain negative. But when negatives and positives interact, they become
    neutral, and are shown as the number 0. Worked Example ("+-+", "+--") ➞
    "+-0" # Compare the first characters of each string, then the next in turn.
    # "+" against a "+" returns another "+". # "-" against a "-" returns another
    "-". # "+" against a "-" returns "0". # Return the string of characters.
    Examples ("--++--", "++--++") ➞ "000000" ("-+-+-+", "-+-+-+") ➞ "-+-+-+"
    ("-++-", "-+-+") ➞ "-+00" Notes The two strings will be the same length.

        for (let i = 0; i < s1.length; i++) {
          s1[i] === s2[i] ? (res += s1[i]) : (res += "0");
        }
        return res;
