    You can print your name on a billboard ad. Find out how much it will cost you. Each character has a default price of £30, but that can be different if you
    are given 2 parameters instead of 1 (allways 2 for Java). You can not use multiplier "*" operator. If your name would be Jeong-Ho Aristotelis, ad would cost
    £600. 20 leters * 30 = 600 (Space counts as a character).
    <script>
      let name = "qwerty";
      let price = 25;
      function billboard(name, price) {
        let cost = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < name.length; i++) {
          cost += price;
        }
        return cost;
      }
      console.log(billboard(name, price));
