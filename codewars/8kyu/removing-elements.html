    DESCRIPTION: Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element. Example:
    ["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] ----- ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...] None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about
    that!
    <script>
      let arr = ["Hello", "Goodbye", "Hello Again"];
      function removeEveryOther(arr) {
        return arr.filter((el, index) => index % 2 == 0);
      }
      console.log(removeEveryOther(arr));
    </script>
