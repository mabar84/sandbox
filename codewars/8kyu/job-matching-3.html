    DESCRIPTION: Consider a matchmaking system which asks developers for their skills. This includes all the skills a developer has used in the past, desires to
    continue to use, and would like to avoid. A candidate has many skills, one may look like this: { name: 'JavaScript', experience: 7, // in years preference:
    'desired' // could be desired, neutral or avoid } On the flip side, the company can create a job with skill requirements. Many companies are just looking
    for bright developers, so Strive also encourages the use of substitute skills. For example, a company can configure 3 years of JavaScript to substitute for
    3 years of CoffeeScript. A job has many skills, one may look like this: { name: 'CoffeeScript', idealYears: 3, // in years substitutions: [{ name:
    'JavaScript' }] } A job skill can be satisfied if the candidate's years experience with the skill is greater than or equal to the ideal years. For a valid
    match, all job skills must be satisfied by the candidate's skills. Additionally, if the candidate desires to use the skill, that skill can recieve a 50%
    experience boost. However, if the candidate wants to avoid a primary (non-substitute) job skill that a company requires the match is invalid. At that point,
    there is no need to check for valid substitutions. Create a method match(candidate, job) that will take a candidate and a job and return a boolean
    indicating if it is a valid match.

      let candidate = {
        skills: [{ name: "CoffeeScript", experience: 3, preference: "neutral" }],
      };
      let job = {
        skills: [{ name: "CoffeeScript", idealYears: 10, substitutions: [{ name: "JavaScript" }] }],
      };

      function match(candidate, job) {
        let skills = candidate.skills;
        return job.skills.every(
          (jobSkill) =>
            !candidate.skills.some((skill) => skill.name == jobSkill.name && skill.preference == "avoid") &&
            candidate.skills.some(
              (skill) =>
                jobSkill.substitutions
                  .map((x) => x.name)
                  .concat(jobSkill.name)
                  .includes(skill.name) && skill.experience * [1, 1.5][+(skill.preference == "desired")] >= jobSkill.idealYears
            )
        );
      }
      console.log(match(candidate, job));
      //   document.getElementById("answer").textContent = match(job, candidates);
