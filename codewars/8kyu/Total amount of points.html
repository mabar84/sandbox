    Our football team has finished the championship. Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in
    the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score. For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...] Points are awarded for each match as
    follows: if x > y: 3 points (win) if x < y: 0 points (loss) if x = y: 1 point (tie) We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the
    number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above. Notes: our team always plays 10 matches in the championship 0 <= x <= 4 0 <=
    y <= 4
