    Task Given three integers a ,b ,c, return the largest number obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, *, () In other words , try
    every combination of a,b,c with [*+()] , and return the Maximum Obtained (Read the notes for more detail about it) Example With the numbers are 1, 2 and 3 ,
    here are some ways of placing signs and brackets: 1 * (2 + 3) = 5 1 * 2 * 3 = 6 1 + 2 * 3 = 7 (1 + 2) * 3 = 9 So the maximum value that you can obtain is 9.
    Notes The numbers are always positive. The numbers are in the range (1  ≤  a, b, c  ≤  10). You can use the same operation more than once. It's not
    necessary to place all the signs and brackets. Repetition in numbers may occur . You cannot swap the operands. For instance, in the given example you cannot
    get expression (1 + 3) * 2 = 8.

      let a = 8,
        b = 3,
        c = 1;
      function expressionMatter(a, b, c) {
        let max = 0;
        if (max < a * (b + c)) {
          max = a * (b + c);
        }
        if (max < a * b * c) {
          max = a * b * c;
        }
        if (max < a + b * c) {
          max = a + b * c;
        }
        if (max < (a + b) * c) {
          max = (a + b) * c;
        }
        return max;
      }

      //   return Math.max(a+b+c, a*b*c, (a+b)*c, a*(b+c));

      console.log(expressionMatter(a, b, c));
