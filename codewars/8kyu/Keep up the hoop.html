  <body>
    Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his
    little brother is better than him. Write a program where Alex can input (n)
    how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging
    message: If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move
    on to tricks". If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it
    until you get it".
    <script>
      const n = 10;
      const hoopCount = (n) =>
        n < 10 ? "Keep at it until you get it" : "Great, now move on to tricks";

      console.log(hoopCount(n));
    </script>
  </body>
