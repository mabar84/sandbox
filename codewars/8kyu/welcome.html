    Your start-up's BA has told marketing that your website has a large audience in Scandinavia and surrounding countries. Marketing thinks it would be great to
    welcome visitors to the site in their own language. Luckily you already use an API that detects the user's location, so this is an easy win. The Task Think
    of a way to store the languages as a database (eg an object). The languages are listed below so you can copy and paste! Write a 'welcome' function that
    takes a parameter 'language' (always a string), and returns a greeting - if you have it in your database. It should default to English if the language is
    not in the database, or in the event of an invalid input.
    <script>
      let language = "irish";
      function greet(language) {
        let db = {
          english: "Welcome",
          czech: "Vitejte",
          danish: "Velkomst",
          dutch: "Welkom",
          estonian: "Tere tulemast",
          finnish: "Tervetuloa",
          flemish: "Welgekomen",
          french: "Bienvenue",
          german: "Willkommen",
          irish: "Failte",
          italian: "Benvenuto",
          latvian: "Gaidits",
          lithuanian: "Laukiamas",
          polish: "Witamy",
          spanish: "Bienvenido",
          swedish: "Valkommen",
          welsh: "Croeso",
          IP_ADDRESS_INVALID: "Welcome",
          IP_ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND: "Welcome",
          IP_ADDRESS_REQUIRED: "Welcome",
        };
        return db[language];
      }
      console.log(greet(language));
    </script>
