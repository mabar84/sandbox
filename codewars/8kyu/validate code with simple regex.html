    This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with
    computers. Write the function circleArea/CircleArea which takes in a Circle
    object and calculates the area of that circle. The Circle class can be seen
    below:
    <script>
      const code = 8;
      const validateCode = (s) => "123".includes(s.toString()[0]);
      console.log(validateCode(code));
    </script>
  </body>
