    An AI has infected a text with a character!! This text is now fully mutated to this character. If the text or the character are empty, return an empty
    string. There will never be a case when both are empty as nothing is going on!! Note: The character is a string of length 1 or an empty string. Example text
    before = "abc" character = "z" text after = "zzz"
    <script>
      let str = "abc",
        char = "0";
      function contamination(str, char) {
        return Array.from({ length: str.length }, () => char).join("");

        // return char.repeat(text.length)

        // return text.replace(/./g, char);
      }
      console.log(contamination(str, char));
    </script>
  </body>
