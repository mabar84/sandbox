    What if we need the length of the words separated by a space to be added at the end of that same word and have it returned as an array? Example(Input --
    Output) "apple ban" -- ["apple 5", "ban 3"] "you will win" -- ["you 3", "will 4", "win 3"] Your task is to write a function that takes a String and returns
    an Array/list with the length of each word added to each element . Note: String will have at least one element; words will always be separated by a space.
    <script>
      let str = "you will win";
      function addLength(str) {
        return str.split(" ").map((el) => el + " " + el.length.toString());
      }
      console.log(addLength(str));
    </script>
  </body>
