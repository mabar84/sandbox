    <p>
      Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number. For example: month 2 (February), is part of
      the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter. Constraint: 1 = month = 12
    </p>

    <script>
      let month = 11;
      const quarterOf = (month) => {
        return Math.ceil(month / 3);
      };
      console.log(quarterOf(month));
    </script>
  </body>
