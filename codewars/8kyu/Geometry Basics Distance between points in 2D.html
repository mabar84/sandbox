    <title>Geometry Basics: Distance between points in 2D</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with
    computers. Point objects have attributes x and y. Write a function
    calculating distance between Point a and Point b. Input coordinates fit in
    range − 50 ⩽ � , � ⩽ 50 −50⩽x,y⩽50. Tests compare expected result and actual
    answer with tolerance of 1e-6.

    <script>
      let str = "Native JavaScript-React-HTML-CSS",
        letter = "-";
      function distanceBetweenPoints(a, b) {
        return 0; // your code here
      }
      console.log(strCount(str, letter));
    </script>
