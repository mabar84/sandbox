    <title>Calculate Meal Total</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Create a function that returns the total of a meal including tip and tax.
    You should not tip on the tax. You will be given the subtotal, the tax as a
    percentage and the tip as a percentage. Please round your result to two
    decimal places.
    <script>
      const calculate_total = (subtotal, tax, tip) =>
        Number(((subtotal * (100 + tax + tip)) / 100).toFixed(2));

      // const calculate_total = (subtotal, tax, tip) => Math.round(subtotal * (100 + tax + tip)) / 100

      console.log(calculate_total(5, 5, 10));
    </script>
