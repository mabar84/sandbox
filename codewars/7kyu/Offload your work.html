  <body>
    You are the best freelancer in the city. Everybody knows you, but what they
    don't know, is that you are actually offloading your work to other
    freelancers and and you rarely need to do any work. You're living the life!
    To make this process easier you need to write a method called workNeeded to
    figure out how much time you need to contribute to a project. Giving the
    amount of time in minutes needed to complete the project and an array of
    pair values representing other freelancers' time in [Hours, Minutes] format
    ie. [[2, 33], [3, 44]] calculate how much time you will need to contribute
    to the project (if at all) and return a string depending on the case. If we
    need to contribute time to the project then return "I need to work x hour(s)
    and y minute(s)" If we don't have to contribute any time to the project then
    return "Easy Money!"
    <script>
      function workNeeded(projectMinutes, freelancers) {
        let res = 0;
        freelancers.forEach((el) => {
          res += el[0] * 60 + el[1];
        });
        res = projectMinutes - res;
        if (res <= 0) return "Easy Money!";
        const h = Math.floor(res / 60);
        const m = res % 60;
        return `I need to work ${h} hour(s) and ${m} minute(s)`;
      }
      console.log(
        workNeeded(141, [
          [1, 55],
          [0, 25],
        ]),
      );
    </script>
  </body>
