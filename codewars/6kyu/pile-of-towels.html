    If there are n=5 towels, a pile may be:blue, red, blue, red, blue If I grab
    t=3 towels during the week, this will be the remaining pile at the end of
    the week: blue, red The basket will contain the following towels: blue, red,
    blue After I sorted the washed towels and put them on the pile according to
    the rule described above, the resulting pile is:blue, red, red, blue, blue
    Your Task: Sort the Pile You are given an initial pile of towels as a
    sequence of the strings "red" and "blue". On top of that, you receive a
    sequence of non-negative integers. The first integer describes the number of
    used towels t in the first week, the second integer describes the number of
    used towels t in the second week and so forth. My question is: How will my
    pile of towels look like in the end, if I use t towels every week and place
    them on top of the the pile according to the rule defined above? Notes It is
    ensured that 0 <= t <= n
