    <title>Largest Radial Sum</title>

  <body>
    The Codewars Council meets at a circular table with n seats. Depending on
    the day d of the month, d people will be chosen as leaders of the council.
    These d leaders are spaced equidistantly from each other on the table, like
    spokes on a wheel. The leaders are chosen based on which grouping of d
    equidistant people have the largest summed honor. The honor of the
    participants for that day in the Council is given in an array arr of length
    n. Return the combined honor of the d leaders of the Council. Given
    conditions - n % d == 0, ie. there will be no invalid cases. All groupings
    go fully around the circle. 1 <= d <= 31, as you can't have 32 days in a
    month. n > 0 because you can't have a Council of 0 people. (You also can't
    have a table with 0 open seats, then it's just a nightstand or something)
    You can have negative honor on Codewars (but it is hard to do) and the
    solution may be negative. Example - [1, 2, 3, 4], 2 -> 6 because max(1+3,
    2+4) == 6 [1, 5, 6, 3, 4, 2], 3 -> 11 because max(1+6+4, 5+3+2) == 11 [1, 1,
    0], 1 -> 1 because max(1, 1, 0) == 1 Hint - Something important to note is
    that you (usually) don't have to evaluate every sum in the array, as after
    n/d repetitions the sums loop over on themselves.

        const k = arr.length / d;
        for (let q = 0; q < k; q++) {
          for (let i = 0; i < d; i++) {
            sum += arr[i * k + q];
          }
          resArr.push(sum);
          if (max < sum) max = sum;
          sum = 0;
        }
        return Math.max(...resArr);
      }

      //   const sum = Array(k).fill(0);

      //   arr.map((e,i)=> sum[i%k] += e);

      //   return Math.max(...sum);
      // }

      console.log(largestRadialSum([-2, -1, -2, -2], 2));
