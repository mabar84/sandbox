    We need the ability to divide an unknown integer into a given number of even
    parts - or at least as even as they can be. The sum of the parts should be
    the original value, but each part should be an integer, and they should be
    as close as possible. Complete the function so that it returns an array of
    integers representing the parts. If the input number is too small to split
    it into requested amount of parts, the additional parts should have value 0.
    Ignoring the order of the parts, there is only one valid solution for each
    input to your function! Example: splitInteger(20, 6) // returns [3, 3, 3, 3,
    4, 4] Inputs The input to your function will always be valid for this kata.
    <script>
      let n = 2,
        p = 2;

      var splitInteger = function (n, p) {
        let arr = [];
        let min = Math.floor(n / p);
        let rest = n - min * p;
        for (let i = 0; i < p - rest; i++) {
          arr[i] = min;
        }
        for (let i = p - rest; i < p; i++) {
          arr[i] = min + 1;
        }
        return arr;
      };

      console.log(splitInteger(n, p));
