    This Kata is intended as a small challenge for my students All Star Code
    Challenge #23 There is a certain multiplayer game where players are assessed
    at the end of the game for merit. Players are ranked according to an
    internal scoring system that players don't see. You've discovered the
    formula for the scoring system! Create a function called scoring() that
    takes an array of Player objects and returns an array of player names, in
    order of descending score (highest score is index 0, 2nd highest is index 1,
    etc.). Each player's score is calculated as follows: Each normal kill is
    worth 100 points Each assist is worth 50 points Each point of damage done is
    worth 0.5 points Each point of healing done is worth 1 point The longest
    kill streak is worth 2^N, where N is the number of kills of the streak
    Environmental kills are worth 500 points (These are counted separately from
    normal kills) For each of the above statistic, a Player object contains a
    respective "key:value" pairing. All values except the 'name' are integers.
    var player1 = { name: "JuanPablo", normKill: 5, assist: 12, damage: 3200,
    healing: 0, streak: 4, envKill: 1 } var player2 = { name: "ProfX", normKill:
    2, assist: 14, damage: 600, healing: 1500, streak: 0, envKill: 0 }
    scoring([player1, player2]); //["JuanPable","ProfX"] // Scores of 3216 and
    2701, respectively.
