    <title>Find Nearest square number</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Your task is to find the nearest square number of a positive integer n. In
    mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the
    square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with
    itself. For example, if n = 111, then the nearest square number equals 121,
    since 111 is closer to 121, the square of 11, than 100, the square of 10. If
    n is already a perfect square (e.g. n = 144, n = 81, etc.), you need to just
    return n. Good luck
    <script>
      const n = 6;
      function nearestSq(n) {
        const l = Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n)) ** 2;
        const r = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(n)) ** 2;
        return n - l < r - n ? l : r;
      }
      console.log(nearestSq(n));

      //   function nearestSq(n) {
      //     return Math.pow(Math.round(Math.sqrt(n)), 2);
      //   }
    </script>
