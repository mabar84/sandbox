    Assume you are creating a webshop and you would like to help the user in the
    search. You have products with brands, prices and name. You have the history
    of opened products (the most recently opened being the first item). Your
    task is to create a list of brands ordered by popularity, if two brands have
    the same popularity level then choose the one which was opened last from the
    two and second the other one. Product popularity is calculated from the
    history. If a product is more times in the history than it is more popular.
    Your function will have one parameter which will be always an array/list of
    object. example product: { name: "Phone", price: 25, brand: "Fake brand" }

        { name: "Samsung Phone", price: 26, brand: "Samsung" },
        { name: "Samsung Phone", price: 27, brand: "Samsung" },
        { name: "HTC Phone", price: 25, brand: "HTC" },

      function sortedBrands(history) {
        return 123;
      }
