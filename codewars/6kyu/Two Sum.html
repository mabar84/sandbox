  <body>
    Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and
    a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when
    added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should
    then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so:
    (index1, index2). For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have
    multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted. The input will
    always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of
    the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different
    items from that array). Based on: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
    twoSum([1, 2, 3], 4) // returns [0, 2] or [2, 0] twoSum([3, 2, 4], 6) //
    returns [1, 2] or [2, 1]
    <script>
      const numbers = [3, 2, 4],
        target = 6;
      function twoSum(numbers, target) {
        for (let i = 0; i <= numbers.length; i++) {
          const index2 = numbers.indexOf(target - numbers[i], i + 1);
          if (index2 > 0) {
            return [i, index2];
          }
        }
      }

      console.log(twoSum(numbers, target));
