    Description A centrifuge is a laboratory device used to separate fluids
    based on density. This is achieved through centrifugal force by spinning a
    collection of test tubes at high speeds. All holes on the centrifuge are
    equally distanced from their neighbouring holes and have the same distance
    to the center. Task Given a centrifuge, return whether it's balanced. A
    centrifuge is called balanced if the center of mass of the collection of
    test tubes coincides with the center of mass of the centrifuge itself. Test
    tubes in this kata all look the same and have the same weight. Input An
    array containing n elements representing a n-hole centrifuge. Elements can
    either be 0 (hole) or 1 (tube inserted). Output Return a boolean indicating
    whether the centrifuge is balanced. Examples Examples of 6-hole centrifuges
    with holes o and tubes x. Direction and starting point don't matter. In
    these examples, we start at the top hole/tube and move in clockwise
    direction. balanced balanced unbalanced [1,0,1,0,1,0] [0,1,0,0,1,0]

    random tests with: centrifuges of size [2 - 55] tubes [1 - n] with n being
    the size given the low sizes, you have the freedom of choice to either pick
    an exact algorithm or a good approximator algorithm that is accurate in the
    low ranges
