    We are diligently pursuing our elusive operative, Matthew Knight, who also
    goes by the alias Roy Miller. He employs a nomadic lifestyle to evade
    detection, constantly moving from one location to another, with each of his
    journeys following a perplexing and non-standard sequence of itineraries.
    Our mission is to decipher the routes he will undertake during each of his
    voyages. Task You've been provided with an array of itinerary routes,
    decipher the precise destinations he will visit in the correct sequence
    according to his meticulously planned itineraries. Example Based on the
    provided routes: [ [USA, BRA], [JPN, PHL], [BRA, UAE], [UAE, JPN] ] The
    correct sequence of destinations is: "USA, BRA, UAE, JPN, PHL" Note: You can
    safely assume that there will be no duplicate locations with distinct
    routes. All routes provided will have non-empty itineraries. There will
    always be at least one (1) route connecting one waypoint to another.
