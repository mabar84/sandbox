    <title>Take a picture</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    You are standing on top of an amazing Himalayan mountain. The view is
    absolutely breathtaking! you want to take a picture on your phone, but...
    your memory is full again! ok, time to sort through your shuffled photos and
    make some space... Given a gallery of photos, write a function to sort
    through your pictures. You get a random hard disk drive full of pics, you
    must return an array with the 5 most recent ones PLUS the next one (same
    year and number following the one of the last). You will always get at least
    a photo and all pics will be in the format YYYY.imgN Examples:
    sortPhotos["2016.img1","2016.img2","2015.img3","2016.img4","2013.img5"])
    ==["2013.img5","2015.img3","2016.img1","2016.img2","2016.img4","2016.img5"]
    sortPhotos["2016.img1"]) ==["2016.img1","2016.img2"]
    <script>
      function sortPhotos(pics) {
        pics = pics
          .map((el) => {
            const first = el.slice(0, 8);
            const last = el.slice(8, 10);
            return last.length === 2 ? first + last : first + "0" + last;
          })
          .sort()
          .slice(-5)
          .map((el) => el.slice(0, 8) + Number(el.slice(8, 10)));

        const last = +pics.at(-1).slice(8, 10) + 1;
        const lastImg = pics.at(-1).slice(0, 8) + last;
        pics.push(lastImg);

        return pics;
      }
    </script>

Testing for [2009.img11, 2012.img6, 2012.img11, 2014.img7, 2014.img1,
2013.img12, 2008.img4, 2011.img18, 2012.img9, 2012.img8, 2013.img8, 2010.img2,
2012.img17, 2009.img2] It should work for random inputs too: expected [
'2012.img9',
