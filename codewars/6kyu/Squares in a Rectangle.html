    <title>Squares in a Rectangle</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    A rectangle can be split up into a grid of 1x1 squares, the amount of which
    being equal to the product of the two dimensions of the rectangle. Depending
    on the size of the rectangle, that grid of 1x1 squares can also be split up
    into larger squares, for example a 3x2 rectangle has a total of 8 squares,
    as there are 6 distinct 1x1 squares, and two possible 2x2 squares. A 4x3
    rectangle contains 20 squares. Your task is to write a function
    `findSquares` that returns the total number of squares for any given
    rectangle, the dimensions of which being given as two integers with the
    first always being equal to or greater than the second.
    <script>
      let x = 2,
        y = 3;

      function findSquares(x, y) {
        return !y ? 0 : x * y + findSquares(x - 1, y - 1);
      }

      //return x&&y&&x*y+findSquares(x-1,y-1);

      //       function findSquares(x, y) {
      //   let s = 0
      //   while (x && y) s += x-- * y--
      //   return s
      // }

      console.log(findSquares(x, y));
