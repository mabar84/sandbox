    Part 2 version Find X â…¡ We have a function that takes in an integer n, and
    returns a number x. Lets call this function findX(n)/find_x(n) (depending on
    your language): function findX(n) { let x = 0; for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 2*n; j++) x += i + j; } return x; } The functions loops
    throught the number n and at every iteration, performs a nested loop on 2*n,
    at each iteration of this nested loop it increments x with the (nested loop
    index + parents loop index). This works well when the numbers are reasonably
    small. findX(2) //=> 16 findX(3) //=> 63 findX(5) //=> 325 But may be slow
    for numbers > 103 So your task is to optimize the function findX/find_x, so
    it works well for large numbers. Input Range 1 <= n <= 106 (105 in JS) Note:
    This problem is more about logical reasoning than it is about finding a
    mathematicial formula, infact there are no complex math formula involved
    <script>
      const findX = (n) => n * n * (3 * n - 2);
      console.log(findX(13));
