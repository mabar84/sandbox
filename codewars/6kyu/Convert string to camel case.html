    <title>Convert string to camel case</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited
    words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be
    capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel
    Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). The next words should be
    always capitalized. Examples "the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to
    "theStealthWarrior" "The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to
    "TheStealthWarrior" "The_Stealth-Warrior" gets converted to
    "TheStealthWarrior"
    <script>
      const str = "the-stealth-warrior";
      const toCamelCase = (str) =>
        str
          .replace(/-/g, "_")
          .split("_")
          .map((el, i) => (i === 0 ? el : el[0].toUpperCase() + el.slice(1)))
          .join("");
      console.log(toCamelCase(str));
    </script>
