    <title>Square sums</title>

  <body>
    This is harder version of Square sums (simple). Square sums Write function
    that, given an integer number N, returns array of integers 1..N arranged in
    a way, so sum of each 2 consecutive numbers is a square. Solution is valid
    if and only if following two criterias are met: Each number in range 1..N is
    used once and only once. Sum of each 2 consecutive numbers is a perfect
    square. Example For N=15 solution could look like this: [ 9, 7, 2, 14, 11,
    5, 4, 12, 13, 3, 6, 10, 15, 1, 8 ] Verification All numbers are used once
    and only once. When sorted in ascending order array looks like this: [ 1, 2,
    3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ] Sum of each 2 consecutive
    numbers is a perfect square: 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 /+\ /+\ /+\ /+\ /+\ /+\
    /+\ [ 9, 7, 2, 14, 11, 5, 4, 12, 13, 3, 6, 10, 15, 1, 8 ] \+/ \+/ \+/ \+/
    \+/ \+/ \+/ 9 25 9 25 9 25 9 9 = 3*3 16 = 4*4 25 = 5*5 If there is no
    solution, return False (empty vector in C++ ; null in Java). For example if
    N=5, then numbers 1,2,3,4,5 cannot be put into square sums row: 1+3=4,
    4+5=9, but 2 has no pairs and cannot link [1,3] and [4,5] Tests constraints:
    1 <= N <= 1300 All possible values of N are tested Brute force solutions can
    only go up to N=50. Code size is restricted to 20K max, and external modules
    are disabled: inlining all results precalculated is not an option. Have fun!
    Simple version of this Kata is here.

          { length: 51 },
