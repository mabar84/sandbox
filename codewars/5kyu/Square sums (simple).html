    <title>Square sums (simple)</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    This is simple version of harder Square Sums. Square sums Write function
    square_sums_row ( or squareSumsRow or SquareSumsRow ) that, given integer
    number N (in range 2..43), returns array of integers 1..N arranged in a way,
    so sum of each 2 consecutive numbers is a square. Solution is valid if and
    only if following two criterias are met: Each number in range 1..N is used
    once and only once. Sum of each 2 consecutive numbers is a perfect square.
    Example For N=15 solution could look like this: [ 9, 7, 2, 14, 11, 5, 4, 12,
    13, 3, 6, 10, 15, 1, 8 ] Verification All numbers are used once and only
    once. When sorted in ascending order array looks like this: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
    6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ] Sum of each 2 consecutive numbers is a
    perfect square: 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 /+\ /+\ /+\ /+\ /+\ /+\ /+\ [ 9, 7, 2,
    14, 11, 5, 4, 12, 13, 3, 6, 10, 15, 1, 8 ] \+/ \+/ \+/ \+/ \+/ \+/ \+/ 9 25
    9 25 9 25 9 9 = 3*3 16 = 4*4 25 = 5*5 If there is no solution, return false
    ( None in Scala, Nothing in Haskell ). For example if N=5, then numbers
    1,2,3,4,5 cannot be put into square sums row: 1+3=4, 4+5=9, but 2 has no
    pairs and cannot link [1,3] and [4,5]. Have fun! Harder version of this Kata
    is here.
